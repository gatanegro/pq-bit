A new interpretation of the photon as a recursive mirror state, not a wave nor a particle within spacetime, but as a binary oscillation within a recursive time operator prior to the emergence of space.

We define this state as the Pq-bit (Photon Quantum Bit), a foundational unit in the 3D Collatz Octave Model (3DCOM).

This resolves the wave-particle duality, explains diffraction and reflection geometries without requiring a pre-existing space background, and provides a basis for experimental tests of recursive photon geometry.



The recent experimental tests of Bohmian mechanics provide strong
evidence of well-defined quantum particle trajectories guided by
pilot waves, challenging classical and orthodox quantum
interpretations.

 In this work, we demonstrate how the 3D Collatz
Octave Model (3DCOM) — with its foundational concept of the photon as
a recursive mirror oscillator Q-bit — naturally explains these
results without invoking classical hidden variables.

We interpret
Bohmian trajectories as recursive attractor paths on the emergent 3D
topology generated by recursive folding of fundamental oscillatory
phase states.

This framework unifies quantum measurement, nonlocal
correlations, and particle-wave duality as manifestations of
recursive field topology, advancing a coherent ontological basis for
quantum phenomena.
