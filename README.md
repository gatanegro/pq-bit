### Pq-bit

A new interpretation of the photon as a recursive mirror state, not a wave nor a particle within spacetime, but as a binary oscillation within a recursive time operator prior to the emergence of space.

We define this state as the Pq-bit (Photon Quantum Bit), a foundational unit in the 3D Collatz Octave Model (3DCOM).

This resolves the wave-particle duality, explains diffraction and reflection geometries without requiring a pre-existing space background, and provides a basis for experimental tests of recursive photon geometry.
